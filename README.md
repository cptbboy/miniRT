# miniRT
[group project with [@tzeck1](https://github.com/tzeck1)] <br> <br>
This project is an introduction to the beautiful world of Raytracing.
Once completed you will be able to render simple Computer-Generated-Images and you
will never be afraid of implementing mathematical formulas again. <br>
<br>
Here you can read more about the concept https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raytracing <br>
And here is the library we used https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42 <br>
